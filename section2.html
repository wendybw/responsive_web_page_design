        In the 19th century, Edinburgh's economy was known for banking and insurance, publishing and printing, and brewing and distilling. 
        Today, its economy is based mainly on financial services, scientific research, higher education, and tourism.[5]
        Tourism is also an important element in the city's economy. As a World Heritage Site, tourists visit historical sites such as Edinburgh Castle,
        the Palace of Holyroodhouse and the Old and New Towns. Their numbers are augmented in August each year during the Edinburgh Festivals, which attracts 4.4 million visitors,
        and generates over Â£100M for the local economy.[6]
